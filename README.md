# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction-Model
- We developed a predictive model to assess the likelihood of survival for breast cancer patients.
- Our approach involved employing algorithms such as Support Vector Classification (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier on a dataset derived from actual breast cancer cases.
- This dataset was divided into an 80% training subset and a reserved portion for testing purposes.
- Following the testing phase, our analysis revealed that the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated superior accuracy not only during the training phase but also in the testing dataset.
- Consequently, we have identified the Random Forest Classifier as the optimal algorithm for classification purposes.
